//! Integration tests for the body-size limits on `POST /api/agents/{id}/upload` (#8181).
//!
//! The upload router carries its own, larger `RequestBodyLimitLayer` sized to `max_upload_size_bytes`, and the comment above it has claimed since it was written that uploads therefore bypass the global `max_request_body_bytes` cap.
//! They did not: the global layer was applied to the finished `app`, which wraps every route already registered, merged sub-routers included, and the smaller of two nested limits is the one that cuts.
//! An operator who raised `max_upload_size_bytes` to 100 MB still had every upload over the 1 MB global cap killed mid-stream, which reaches a browser as `NetworkError` rather than a status.
//!
//! These tests run against the production router (`server::build_router`), because that is where the ordering lives — a hand-rolled router in the test would assert on a layer stack nobody serves.
//!
//! Run: cargo test -p librefang-api --test upload_body_limit_test
